Food API project-

#Description-
 This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for accessing food-related data through an API. The application is built using Angular framework and offers the following features:

1. Search Bar
The application includes a search bar that allows users to search for specific food items or related information and the system will display the relevant results based on the search input.


2. Sorting by ID in Increasing Order
The food items can be sorted based on their ID in increasing order. This feature enables users to arrange the displayed items according to their unique identifier, facilitating easy navigation and browsing.

3. Sorting by ID in Decreasing Order
In addition to sorting in increasing order, the application also provides the option to sort the food items by their ID in decreasing order. This feature allows users to reverse the order of the displayed items, providing a different perspective for browsing.

4. Add to Favorites
Users have the ability to add food items to their favorites list. This feature allows users to mark specific items as their favorites.

5. Remove Favorite
If a user decides to remove a food item from their favorites list, this feature allows them to do so with a simple action. By clicking on the "Remove Favorite" option associated with a specific item, it will be removed from the favorites list.

6. Image View on Click
By clicking on an image associated with a food item, users can view the image in a single page.
